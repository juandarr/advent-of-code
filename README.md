# Advent of Code 2023

My goal this year is to solve Advent of Code 2023 using the new programming language [Mojo](). Initially I will explore the language basics: variables, data types, control flow, loops, functions, classes?/structs, ownership. In parallel I will be solving the Advent challenges. Normally the first ones are quite easy, scaling in complexity at around challenge 16 or so. We'll see how it goes this year.
