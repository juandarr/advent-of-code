# Advent of Code 2023

My goal this year is to solve Advent of Code 2023 using the new programming language [Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/). Initially I will explore the language basics: variables, data types, control flow, loops, functions, classes?/structs, ownership. In parallel I will be solving the Advent challenges. Normally the first ones are quite easy, scaling in complexity at around challenge 16 or so. We'll see how it goes this year.

## Mojo basics

### Run
You run mojo programs using `mojo filename.mojo`

### Build
Programs can be build using `mojo build filaname.mojo`.
