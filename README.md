# Advent of Code

This repository collects all input files, solutions, template algorithms, data structures and other supporting information used to solve the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges in different years: 2022, 2023.

## AOC 2023

My goal this year was to solve Advent of Code 2023 using the new programming language [Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/). Initially I will explore the language basics: variables, data types, control flow, loops, functions, classes?/structs, ownership. In parallel I will be solving the Advent challenges. Normally the first ones are quite easy, scaling in complexity at around challenge 16 or so. We'll see how it goes this year.

## Mojo basics

### Run
You run mojo programs using `mojo filename.mojo`

### Build
Programs can be build using `mojo build filaname.mojo`.

## AOC 2022
I solved this challenge the past year. I will be storing the main files, algorithms and data structures use for the solutions and documenting my line of thinking while solving each challenge.
